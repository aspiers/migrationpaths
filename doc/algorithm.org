* terminology
*** state (node in graph)
    unique mapping of VMs to hosts
*** move (edge in graph)
***** single, sane VM migration from one node to another
***** sane means it satisfies all constraints
***** transient vs non-transient constraints
      - transient constraints
        - don't necessary apply to all states
          e.g. constraint on total memory of physical host A available
          for VMs means host A can only accommodate VM X for some states
          when there is enough memory free
      - non-transient constraints
        - always apply
          e.g. 32-bit hosts can never host 64-bit VMs
      - if while searching the tree, a non-sane migration is encountered
        - can't be due to non-transient constraints
          otherwise end state would not be sane
        - therefore surmountable by finding the right order of migrations
*** required move
    one which takes a VM to its ultimate destination
* design notes and other considerations
*** marking nodes as visited
    - nodes could be uniquely represented as the set of migrations performed
      - order performed doesn't matter
        since same state is achieved regardless of order of migrations,
        given that migration sequence has been sanely constructed
*** Dijkstra doesn't prune the search tree enough => too slow
*** Shortest path is too hard/ambitious
    requires investigating way too many possibilities
*** Breadth first requires iterating over way too many possibilities
    before arriving at an answer
*** Therefore depth first required, i.e. with backtracking
*** algorithm should be reversible / symmetrical
    - i.e. optimal path A->B also gives optimal reverse path B->A
    - so "smallest/largest first" type strategies don't make sense
*** new algorithm
***** state.solve(REQUIRED)
      - REQUIRED is list of required moves
      - pick any one
        - if sane from current state
          - recurse depth-first from new state
        - if not sane
          - try to displace VMs from move's target to make it sane
          - if this fails, backtrack
      - Need to update required moves when non-required moves are made
      - Always prefer required moves
***** state.displace(FOR, FROM, LOCKED, REQUIRED)
      - FOR is the VM we are displacing on behalf of
      - FROM is the VM host we are displacing from
      - LOCKED is a list of VMs we are not allowed to touch
        This prevents deadlock / infinite loop, e.g. 
          P:a60 Q:b60 R:
        to
          P:b60 Q:c60 R:
        requires displacement of Q for a, but then moving
        b:Q>P would require displacement of P for b which
        cannot be allowed, therefore b:Q>R is the only solution.
      - breadth first
      - When we backtrack, do we need to remember why?
        i.e. displace something in order to make a move possible, then
        immediately retry that move?
        - Yes
      - solution search order should prioritise:
        - required moves first
        - moves which are immediately possible, to minimise search tree 
        - (maybe) moves which would immediately satisfy need to move FOR to FROM
          i.e. "just big enough"
          b) bigger one
          c) smaller one in decreasing order of size
      - once a single displacement has
***** cases
      - can do required move
      - need to move something else out of the way before doing required move;
        i.e. backtrack:
        a) something else can be another required move
        b) or an unrequired move
        c) or a selection of a) and/or b)
      - cannot do required move 
***** questions:
      - Need to keep track how "explored" a node is?
        - A node is "fully explored" when all possible moves from it have
          been fully explored
        - A node is "half explored" when all required moves from it have
          been FIXME explored
      - When making an unrequired move, does it matter whether it
        moves a VM which has a required move?  Suspected answer:
        - sometimes, sometimes not, but no easy way to tell
