* future work
*** NEXT add new debug level which only shows partial path
*** NEXT fix slow testcase
*** NEXT try all top-level possibilities in _solve() and choose best
***** within a time limit
*** NEXT respect cost function
*** NEXT nova fake driver
    - copy state in, and run simulations
*** NEXT continual re-orientation
    - other migrations happening during rearrangement?
    - error handling
*** NEXT implement simple consolidation and rebalancing heuristics, and test
*** NEXT performance profiling
*** NEXT increase soak test dimensions
*** NEXT incorporate offline migration with higher cost
